## General Information About the Standard

### What is papiNet?
papiNet is a global paper, forest products and bioproducts industry e-Business initiative. papiNet consists of an XML set of standard electronic documents that facilitates the flow of information among parties engaged in buying, selling, and distribution of paper, forest and bio related products. papiNet serves as an enabler for collaborative electronic business.

### How was papiNet created?
papiNet is a joint effort supported by papiNet Europe, a consortium of European paper and forest products companies, and papiNet NA, a group of North American paper and forest products companies, distributors, printers, and customers.
papiNet Europe
papiNet started as a project within the Publishing part of the paper industry. A number of major paper suppliers, large German publishers and printers worked together to create a common standard for electronic business transactions. Soon there was a requirement to develop supporting software for handling the transactions via the Internet. This work turned out so well, that it was decided to enlarge the pilot project to encompass other parts of the industry.
