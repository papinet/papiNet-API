                              - **NetNetWeight**: The net weight of the product without any packaging and conversion components.
                              - **NetWeight**: The net weight of the product that may include certain conversion components, but does not include tare weight.
                              - **NominalWeight**: The calculated weight that is derived from other measurements. For example, the length of paper multiplied by the width of the paper and multiplied by the specified basis weight could be used to derive a nominal weight.
                              - **TareWeight**: The weight of the packaging and the furnishing materials.
